        The GT 63S is the top of the line variant of the GT 4-Door and features the same 4.0L M177 twin-turbocharged V8 engine as in the GT 63, but receives further tuning to produce  630 hp and 900 N⋅m  of torque.

        The GT 63S will reportedly accelerate from 0–100 km/h in 3.2 seconds and attain a top speed of 315 km/h as tested by the manufacturer. Auto Bild tested 0–100 km/h in 3.0 seconds, 0–160 km/h in 6.6 seconds and 0–200 km/h in 10.2 seconds.

        Additionally, all of the equipment and features from the GT 63, as well as the selectable "Drift Mode", which directs power solely to the rear wheels, comes as standard on the GT 63S as well.
        “This is a V8, bi-turbo, four-liter,” said Van Houdt. “Now, you might think, ‘Yes, other products have it.’ But the difference being is that [Dominic Prew] built this motor. He built it with his hands.”     </p>
